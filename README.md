# React Native TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'name')

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'name')`. This error occurs when attempting to access a property of an object that is currently null or undefined.  The example provided shows how this can happen during asynchronous data fetching.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app.
4. Observe the error (if it doesn't occur automatically, you may need to simulate a failed network request).

## Solution

The solution involves implementing proper error handling and conditional rendering to avoid accessing properties of null or undefined objects.  This is typically done with optional chaining or nullish coalescing.
